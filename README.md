# TrackTV_WEB
Track.tv is a mockup of a movie database. The app runs on top of remote Oracle Database with most of the domain logic implemented in stored procedures. An ASP.NET web application is used as a client, with a custom ORM used to provide data consistency.

See [project_analysis.pdf](TrackTV_WEB/blob/master/project_analysis.pdf)  for a comprehensive analysis of of the project.
See [procedures.pdf](TrackTV_WEB/blob/master/procedures.pdf) for implementation of the pl/sql procedures.

Only two views from the user interface are implemented. Connection to the database also works only when connected to the network of VÅ B-TUO, since the server is currently stored there.
